I am a Program-Specific Researcher at [Graduate School of Informatics](http://www.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/), [Kyoto University](https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/ja), Kyoto, Japan. I am working with Professor [Eiji Oki](http://icn.cce.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/english/english_oki) at [ICN](http://icn.cce.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/english) Lab.

My research interest lies in modeling and algorithm design for communication and computer networks. At a high level, I would like to bridge the theoretical approaches and the practical applications. My goal is to achieve reliable, cost-effective, flexible, scalable, and intelligent networks by leveraging techniques from optimization, queueing theory, graph theory, and machine learning. Recently, my work focuses on: 1) resource allocation in network virtualization/softwarization; 2) routing and spectrum allocation in optical networks; 3) artificial intelligence in network management.
