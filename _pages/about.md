I am a Program-Specific Researcher at the Department of Communications and Computer Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan, where I received the Ph.D. degree in 2020.

My research interest lies in modeling and algorithm design for communication and computer networks. At a high level, I would like to bridge the theoretical approaches and the practical applications. My goal is to achieve reliable, cost-effective, flexible, scalable, and intelligent networks by leveraging techniques from optimization, queueing theory, graph theory, and machine learning. 

Recently, my work focuses on: 1) resource allocation in network virtualization; 2) routing and spectrum allocation in optical networks; 3) artificial intelligence in network management.
