### Resource allocation in network virtualization
Network virtualization has been introduced as a key role in the next-generation networking paradigm to fend off the ossification of traditional networks. While network virtualization leads to a more flexible network by adopting the technologies of **computer virtualization**, **network function virtualization (NFV)**, and **software-defined networking (SDN)**, it brings challenges for network management, one of which is how to efficiently allocate network resources considering different requirements such as reliability and latency. We study resource allocation for different problems with typical application scenarios in network virtualization.

While network virtualization leads to a more flexible network by adopting the technologies of **computer virtualization**, **network function virtualization (NFV)**, and **software-defined networking (SDN)**, it brings challenges for network management, one of which is how to efficiently allocate resources with concerning the reliability issue. Resource allocation with **protection** strategies is an essential requirement for network virtualization. We study reliable resource allocation for different problems with typical application scenarios in network virtualization.

### Latency-aware service deployment
NFV provides a flexible and efficient way to implement network functions traditionally deployed on dedicated devices as virtual network functions (VNFs) running on commodity servers. Network resources with NFV can be provisioned elastically to support heterogeneous services, each of which is represented by a forwarding graph constructed by a set of VNFs. A critical problem for service providers is hwo to deploy the requested services, including **placing VNFs**, **allocating resources**, and **scheduling traffic**.
