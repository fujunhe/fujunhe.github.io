### Reliable resource allocation in network virtualization
Network virtualization has been introduced as a key role in the next-generation networking paradigm to fend off the ossification of traditional networks. While network virtualization leads to a more flexible network by adopting the technologies of **computer virtualization**, **network function virtualization (NFV)**, and **software-defined networking (SDN)**, it brings challenges for network management, one of which is how to efficiently allocate resources with concerning the reliability issue. Resource allocation with **protection** strategies is an essential requirement for network virtualization. We study reliable resource allocation for different problems with typical application scenarios in network virtualization.
